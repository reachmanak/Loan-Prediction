## Project/Goals
To bulid a loan estimator model for deployment. This project is helped us predict if loans should be provided or not to customers

## Hypothesis
• Salary: Applicant with high income should have more chances of loan approval.

• Previous History: Applicant who have repaid their previous debts should have higher chances of loan approval.

• Loan Amount: Loan Approval should also depend on the loan amount. If the loan amount is less, chances of loan approval should be high.

• Loan Term: Loan for less time and less amount should have higher chances of approval.

• Property Area: Properties in urban areas have higher growth perspectives and increment in valuation of the property.

## EDA 
Had to check the dependency of variable on loan status(target). Made multiple charts and plots to understand the distribution of data.


## Process

### EDA: Had to check the dependency of variable on loan status(target). Made multiple charts and plots to understand the distribution of data. Filled in missing values through median and mode. 
### Made few more features to explore te data and dependency. Divided the data into train and test datasets to build logistic regression, random forest, and decision tree model. Tuned hypermeters to get better accuracy

## Results/Demo
had best results with logistic regression of 78% accuracy.

Tried Random Forest and Dcision Tree too
Deployment of model through flask and wrote Json Code for Prediction

used Gridsearch for hypertuning of parameters
